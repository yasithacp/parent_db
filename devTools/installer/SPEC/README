This directory contains the NSIS scripts to create a Windows installer.

Inorder to compile the script you will need to have NSIS installed in
the build system (Linux or Windows).
You will also need the md5 plugin for NSIS (http://nsis.sourceforge.net/MD5_plugin)

Read makensis.txt in the devDocs directory for instructions on compiling NSIS.

How to compile the installer
--------------------------

If you have makensis directly accessible from the command line
(Bash or Command prompt) you could use phing to build the installer as
well.

Please make sure to copy the latest XAMPP for Windows files to the
parent directory of the project directory

e.g.
	<Parent Directory>
	|
	+-- orangehrm
	| +-- build
	| +-- ...
	| +-- devTools
	| | +-- installer
	| | | +-- SOURCE
	| | | | +-- content
	| | | | +-- xampp
	| | | +-- SPEC
	| | | | +-- Include
	| | | | +-- ...
	| | +-- ...
	| +-- ...
	+-- xampp ; Copy XAMPP for Windows files here

Simply build the target win-dist to compile the installer.

e.g. From the build directory run

	$ phing dist.win

If you do not have phing installer you will have to create the
following directory structure and run makensis on the main.nsi script

* Required directory structure

	<Parent Directory>
	|
	+-- installer
	| +-- SOURCE
	| | +-- content ; Copy the content directory from devTools to here
	| | +-- orangehrm-x.x.x ; Copy OrangeHRM release directory here (eg: build/dist/orangehrm-2.2.2 or unzip 
        | |                       the source archive here (remove the zip file afterwards))
        | |                       make sure this directory name matches the constant OrangeHRMPath set in main.nsi
	| | +-- xampp ; Copy XAMPP for Windows files here and then copy xampp directory from devTools
	| +-- SPEC ; Installer scripts directory
	| | +-- Include
	| | +-- ...
	| +-- ...
	+-- ...

To run makensis on the main.nsi script run

	$ makensis /path/to/main.nsi
